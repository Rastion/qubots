# Audio Optimization Problem

An audio signal enhancement optimization problem implementation for the Qubots framework. This problem reads audio signal data from CSV files and optimizes signal processing parameters to maximize audio quality while minimizing noise and distortion.

## üéµ Problem Description

The audio optimization problem implements a multi-objective signal processing optimization:

- **Primary Objective**: Maximize overall audio quality score
- **Secondary Objectives**: 
  - Minimize noise levels
  - Minimize harmonic distortion
- **Constraints**: 
  - Signal gain bounds (0.1 ‚â§ gain ‚â§ 2.0)
  - EQ adjustment limits (¬±12 dB)
  - Noise gate threshold range (-60 to -20 dB)
  - Compression ratio limits (1.0 to 10.0)
  - Filter cutoff frequency bounds (20 Hz to Nyquist frequency)

## üéõÔ∏è Signal Processing Parameters

The optimization controls the following audio processing parameters for each signal:

- **Gain**: Overall signal amplification (0.1 - 2.0x)
- **EQ (3-band)**: Low, mid, and high frequency adjustments (¬±12 dB)
- **Noise Gate**: Threshold for noise reduction (-60 to -20 dB)
- **Compressor**: Dynamic range compression ratio (1.0 - 10.0)
- **Phase Correction**: Phase adjustment in degrees (¬±180¬∞)
- **Filter Cutoff**: Low-pass filter cutoff frequency (Hz)
