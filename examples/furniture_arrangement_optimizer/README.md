- Acceptance rate and convergence analysis

### 4. Detailed Room Layout
- 2D floor plan with accurate furniture dimensions
- Clearance zones (red areas showing required space)
- Furniture orientation indicators (arrows for rotated pieces)
- Room features (doors, windows, electrical outlets)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Details

### Simulated Annealing Process
1. **Initialization**: Start with random furniture arrangement
2. **Temperature Schedule**: Geometric cooling with configurable rate
3. **Move Generation**: Three types of spatial moves
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Metropolis criterion with temperature-based probability
5. **Termination**: When temperature drops below threshold or max iterations reached

### Move Types

#### Translation Moves
- Small random position adjustments (¬±20cm by default)
- Respects room boundaries
- Maintains furniture within valid placement areas

#### Rotation Moves  
- 90-degree rotations for rotatable furniture
- Automatically adjusts position if needed to stay in bounds
- Only applied to furniture that can rotate

#### Swapping Moves
- Exchange positions of two furniture pieces
- Helps escape local optima
- Maintains individual furniture orientations

### Temperature Schedule
- **Initial Temperature**: High enough to accept most moves initially
- **Cooling Rate**: Geometric reduction (typically 0.95)
- **Minimum Temperature**: Stopping criterion (typically 1.0)
